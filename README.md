Pypush
======

Problem
-------
I often work on files that are stored remotely. I can either work on them
locally and not have to deal with network latency, or I can work remotely and
not need to reupload files every time I change them. Both options are
frustrating and leave a lot to be desired.

Solution
--------
Pypush continuously monitors your local directory and immediately uploads any
changes you make to your specified remote directory. You get the best of both
worlds. You can also just make some changes locally, then periodically run
pypush to synchronize all those changes to the remote directory.

What sets pypush apart is its real-time sync, and its integration with git. Any
local files ignored by git will not be pushed to the remote machine (note that
there is a different between untracked files and explicitly ignored files).

Requirements
------------
Requires a Unix system - Mac or Linux. May work on Windows with the right tools
installed. If you are interested in getting it to work on Windows, [open a new
issue](https://github.com/viveksjain/pypush/issues/new). The remote machine must
have rsync installed, and the local directory must be a git repository (although
it doesn't need to have any commits or staged files).

Installation
------------
Pypush can be installed using `pip`:

    pip install pypush

Or you can use `easy_install`:

    easy_install pypush

Usage
-----
```
usage: pypush.py [-h] [-q] [-v] [-s] [-i] [-e] [-d][--version] user@hostname dest

Continuously push changes in the current directory to a remote server. Files
that are ignored by git will not be pushed (therefore the current directory
must be inside a git repo).

positional arguments:
  user@hostname       the remote machine (and optional user name) to login to
  dest                the path to the remote directory to push changes to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet         quiet mode - do not show output whenever a file changes
  -v, --verbose       verbose mode - run rsync in verbose mode
  -s, --skip-init     skip the initial one-way sync performed on startup
  -i, --show-ignored  print output even when ignored files are created or
                      modified (this flag is overridden by quiet mode)
  -e, --exit-after    exit after the initial sync, i.e. do not monitor the
                      directory for changes
  -d, --disable-git   do not exclude any files ignored by git
  --version           show program's version number and exit

WARNING: pypush only performs a one-way sync. If you make changes directly on
the remote machine, they may be overwritten at any time by changes made
locally.

Example:

	pypush viveksjain@myserver.com '~/www'
